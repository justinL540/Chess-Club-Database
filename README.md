This project is a relational database built in Microsoft Access to manage a mock chess club. It tracks players, tournaments, game results, and tournament expenses.

Key Features
- Players: Name, rating, contact info, location, violations, and tournament/game history
- Tournaments: Rated/open status, dates, format, entry fee, location
- Games: Player matchups with results (Win/Loss/Draw)
- Expenses: Travel, lodging, food, equipment, and more per tournament

Design Process
- Created relational diagrams to define table relationships using primary and foreign keys
- Normalized data to avoid redundancy and ensure integrity
- Built queries using Access's GUI and SQL view:
- Player history, win/loss summaries, upcoming tournaments, etc.
- Developed reports for performance tracking and budget summaries
- This setup helps the club manage tournaments, track eligibility, monitor fair play, and review financials effectively.
